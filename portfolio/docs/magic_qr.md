### Offline Data Transmission via QR Codes

**Runners Up, Hackout Hackathon (Oct 2019)**

Who needs the internet when you have QR codes? We certainly didn't!

### The Idea

We developed a broadcasting service that can transfer compressed data using a series of QR codes. It's like playing a high-tech game of pass-the-parcel, but with data.

### How It Works

1. Data is compressed and split into chunks
2. Each chunk is converted into a QR code
3. QR codes are displayed in sequence
4. Receiving device scans the QR codes and reconstructs the data

### Potential Applications

- Sharing information in areas with no internet connectivity
- Secure data transfer without using traditional networks
- Interactive museum exhibits or educational tools
