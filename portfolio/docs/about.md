Hey friend ðŸ‘‹ My name is Harsh Patel.
<br />
I'm a full-stack engineer based in India. I'm a zero-to-one builder who loves creating products and businesses that didn't exist before.

### Where I work?
I'm currently shaping the future of learning at Superr, where we're building cutting-edge ed-tech products for the next generation.


### My beliefs
My journey in tech has been driven by three core beliefs:

1. Ideas trump opinions
2. Results matter more than effort
3. Quality craftsmanship is key
