Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Harsh Patel. I'm a full-stack engineer based in India. I'm a zero-to-one builder who loves creating products and businesses that didn't exist before.

I'm currently shaping the future of learning at Superr, where we're building cutting-edge ed-tech products for the next generation. My journey in tech has been driven by three core beliefs:

1. Ideas trump opinions
2. Results matter more than effort
3. Quality craftsmanship is key

When I'm not coding, you can find me contributing to open-source projects, tinkering with new technologies, or probably debugging my coffee machine.
