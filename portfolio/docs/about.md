Hey friend, I'm Harsh Patel. I'm a software engineer based in India. I'm a zero-to-one builder who loves creating products and businesses that didn't exist before.

<br />
I'm currently shaping the future of learning at Superr, where we're building cutting-edge ed-tech products for the next generation.

### Where?
