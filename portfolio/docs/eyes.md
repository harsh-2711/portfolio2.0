### Smart Camera System for the Visually Impaired

**Second Runners Up, IEEE Humanitarian Contest (Mar 2019 - Jun 2019)**

We set out to prove that technology can be a real eye-opener, especially for those who can't see.

### The Vision (pun intended)

Create a smart camera system that can be fitted directly onto spectacles, acting as an AI-powered assistant for the visually impaired.

### Features

- Sign Recognition: Reads signs and text in the environment
- Object Recognition: Identifies objects and obstacles
- Depth Recognition: Provides spatial awareness
- Smart Navigation: Assists in navigating surroundings
- Personal Assistant: Offers voice-based interaction and support

### Impact

This project has the potential to significantly improve the independence and quality of life for visually impaired individuals.
