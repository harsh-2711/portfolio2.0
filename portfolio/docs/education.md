I earned my stripes at the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology in Gandhinagar, India. 

- **Degree**: Honors in ICT with minors in CS
- **GPA**: 3.5 out of 4
- **Graduation Year**: 2021

During my time there, I dabbled in everything from Operating Systems to Computational Modeling. It's where I learned that the only thing more complex than a recursive algorithm is trying to explain it to your non-tech friends at a party.
