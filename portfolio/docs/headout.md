## Key Achievements

### Vendor Onboarding
I engineered a generic interface for vendor onboarding which required minimal API configurations, enabling near real-time inventory management. The impact was substantial: we managed to slash order fulfillment time by approximately **40%**. This improvement not only enhanced the efficiency of our operations but also significantly improved the experience for both vendors and customers.

### Rating Generator
I devised an innovative algorithm to generate a specified number of ratings within a provided range. By employing a Gaussian distributed spread, we enhanced the accuracy and realism of the vendor's product listing console. This feature added depth to our product listings, providing more meaningful information to potential customers.
