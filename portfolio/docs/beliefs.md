title: Beliefs

My journey in tech has been driven by these core beliefs:

1. Ideas trump opinions

2. Results matter more than effort

3. Quality craftsmanship is the key

4. “Write important things down” doesn’t mean “record actions already taken.”

5. “Absence of evidence“ is not “evidence of absence.“
