**Senior Product Engineer** | Jan 2021 - Jan 2024

At Lyearn, I donned my product engineering hat and set out to revolutionize how we approach education technology.

### Highlights

- **Performance Boost**: Improved core API latency by 30%. Because waiting for data is so last semester.
- **Reporting Reinvented**: Created a dynamic reporting module that crunches millions of documents. It's like giving our data a PhD in insights.
- **Integration Innovation**: Developed a generic integrations module, making third-party app integration 50% more efficient. It's like being a digital polyglot.
- **Elasticsearch Expertise**: Optimized queries and developed custom plugins, speeding things up by 37%. Search results now arrive faster than you can say "Elasticsearch".
- **The Great Migration**: Led the charge from NodeJS to Golang, cutting processing time by 80% for heavy tasks. It's like teaching a sloth to run a marathon.
- **GraphQL Evolution**: Orchestrated a move to Federated GraphQL architecture. Because sometimes, breaking up (your architecture) is the right thing to do.

### Tech Toolbox

```jsx
const techStack = [
  "GraphQL",
  "REST",
  "PostgreSQL",
  "MongoDB",
  "Redis",
  "Kafka",
  "gRPC",
  "NodeJS",
  "TypeScript",
  "Golang",
  "Kubernetes",
];

function shuffleTech(array) {
  // Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm
  for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
  }
  return array;
}

console.log("Today's tech combo:", shuffleTech(techStack).join(" + "));
```
