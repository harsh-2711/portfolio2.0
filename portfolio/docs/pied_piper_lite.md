Imagine Google Drive, but for those times when the internet decides to take a vacation. That's what we built.

### Challenge

In a world where we take internet connectivity for granted, what happens when you're in a place with no signal? How do you share important documents or access your files?

### Solution

I created a platform that allows users to store and share data without internet service. It's like having a personal cloud in your pocket.

### Impact

- Enables data sharing in remote areas or during network outages
- Useful for fieldwork, disaster relief, or just when your WiFi decides to throw a tantrum
