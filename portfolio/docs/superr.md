At Superr, we're not just building ed-tech products; we're reimagining the future of learning. As a Lead Software Engineer, I wear many hats (and sometimes a cape when debugging calls for it).

## What I'm Up To

### Team Leadership & Solutions Architect
At Superr, I've taken on the role of leading a team of a engineers, focusing on architecting and implementing critical solutions in an EdTech environment. Our main achievement has been the design of an innovative **offline-first** system architecture for both mobile and web clients. This solution ensures a seamless user experience even in low-connectivity situations, a crucial feature for our diverse user base.

<br />
In addition to system architecture, I've been heavily involved in database optimization. By implementing SQL database optimizations, we've significantly improved our system's ability to handle peak load writes efficiently. This enhancement has been particularly crucial during high-traffic periods, ensuring consistent performance for our users.

### AI Initiatives
One of the most exciting aspects of my role has been spearheading AI initiatives. I've led the development of multiple prototypes for content generation assistants and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines. Through these efforts, we've managed to improve context-specific generation accuracy for our content creation process by almost **68%**.

Our AI-driven content generation has not only improved accuracy but also significantly reduced the time required for creating educational materials, allowing educators to focus more on student interaction.
