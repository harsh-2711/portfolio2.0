**Lead Software Engineer** | Jan 2024 - Present
<br />

At Superr, we're not just building ed-tech products; we're reimagining the future of learning. As a Lead Software Engineer, I wear many hats (and sometimes a cape when debugging calls for it).

### What I'm Up To

- **Team Leadership**: Guiding a team of 7 brilliant minds, ensuring we hit our deadlines while keeping our code and spirits high.
- **Architecting Solutions**: Designed an offline-first system that works seamlessly on both mobile and web. Because learning shouldn't stop just because the internet did.
- **Database Wizardry**: Optimized our SQL databases to handle writes at peak load. It's like teaching a firehose to write poetry.
- **AI Initiatives**: Developed prototypes for content generation assistants and RAG pipelines, improving accuracy by 68%. Who says AI can't be a team player?
